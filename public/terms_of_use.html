        Application (the “Application Store”). You agree to abide by any relevant terms of service or other legal
        agreement that governs your use of a given payment processing service and/or method. If you purchase Premium

            SUSPENSION, TERMINATION OR BREACH HEREOF, EVEN IF PHI NGUYỄN OR ANY OTHER APPLICATION PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
            OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE

            NGUYỄN ON ANY OF THE SERVICES DURING THE THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING ANY CLAIM.</strong>
        The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. As some
        jurisdictions do not allow some of the exclusions or limitations set forth above, some of these exclusions or
        limitations may not apply to you. In such event the liability of the Application Parties will be limited to the

        further acknowledge that Apple has no responsibility for addressing any claims relating to the Application or
        Services or your possession and/or use of the Application or Services, including, but not limited to: (i)

    <p>You hereby affirm that you are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations,
        affirmations, representations and warranties set forth in the Terms and Conditions, and to abide by and comply
        with the Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <h3>31.5 Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>The Terms and Conditions (consisting of the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Terms) represent the
        complete agreement between you and <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong> and may only be amended as set forth under
        Amendments above or as
        otherwise expressly provided therein. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is held to be unenforceable,

    <h3>31.7 Waiver</h3>
    <p>The failure of any Application Party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions
        will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms and Conditions
        will be effective only if in writing and signed by <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong>.</p>

    <h3>31.8 Headings</h3>
    <p>The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of the Terms and
        Conditions, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.</p>

    <h3>31.9 Governing Law and Disputes</h3>
    <p><strong>(Important: Please review this section carefully and consult with legal counsel to ensure it is
            appropriate for your jurisdiction and circumstances.)</strong></p>
    <p>The Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the State of California as such laws are applied to
        agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents, and by the
        laws of the United States. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980)
        is hereby excluded in its entirety from application to the Terms and Conditions. You agree that the Services
        shall be deemed solely based in California and each a passive Service that does not give rise to personal
        jurisdiction over <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong>, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the State
        of California.
        Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to any of the Terms and Conditions, or the breach,
        enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of
        any of the Terms and Conditions to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be
        administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS), and the arbitration shall be conducted
        with a single arbitrator. Furthermore, you agree that neither you nor <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong> will join any
        claim with the
        claim of any other person or entity in arbitration; that no claim will be resolved on a class-wide basis; and
        that neither you nor <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong> will assert any claim in a representative capacity on behalf of
        anyone else.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong> shall be allowed to apply for
        injunctive remedies (or
        an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. If you file an arbitration complaint against
        <strong>Phi
            Nguyễn</strong>, <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong> agrees to pay for any portion of the initial filing fee that
        exceeds $250; after the initial
        filing fees, the parties will share the costs of arbitration equally. You agree not to commence or prosecute any
        action against any Application Party other than by filing an arbitration complaint in accordance with this
        paragraph. <strong>IMPORTANTLY, BY AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT
            YOU HAVE TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND ANY RIGHT YOU HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>31.10 Injunctive Relief</h3>
    <p>You acknowledge that the obligations made hereunder to <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong> are of a unique and
        irreplaceable nature, the
        loss of which shall irreparably harm <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong> and which cannot be replaced by monetary
        damages alone so that
        <strong>Phi Nguyễn</strong> shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations
        of posting any
        bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to
        seek injunctive or other equitable relief.
    </p>

    <h3>31.11 Third Party Beneficiaries and Agreements</h3>
    <p>If you downloaded the Application from the Apple App Store, you acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s
        subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of the Terms and Conditions, and that, upon your acceptance of the
        Terms and Conditions, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the
        Terms and Conditions against you as a third party beneficiary hereof. You agree to comply with, and your license
        to use the Application and Services is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms
        of agreement, including those of any Application Store, as may be applicable, when using the Application and/or
        Services.</p>

    <h3>31.12 No Partnership, Agency, Joint Venture</h3>
    <p>The Terms and Conditions do not create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture.</p>

    <h3>31.15 Severability</h3>
    <p>If any of the provisions of the Terms and Conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason
        unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
        any remaining provisions.</p>
